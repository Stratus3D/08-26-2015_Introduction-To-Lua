# 08-26-2015 Introduction To Lua


Most popular scripting languages now contain many paradigm specific and platform specific features that increase the complexity of the language. 
Few of these languages are simple enough to be embedded in existing applications easily. 
Lua's extensibility and simplicity makes it an ideal choice for embedded scripting. 
Lua is often embedded in video games, desktop GUI applications, server software, and even mobile applications. 
This talk covers the basics of the Lua. 
Trevor will demonstrate how Lua's simplicity allows for quick development of small utility scripts. 
I will also show how Lua's powerful meta-mechanisms allow for rapid development of software in prototypal OO, classical OO, and functional paradigms. 
At the end of the talk I will integrate Lua into an existing application.
