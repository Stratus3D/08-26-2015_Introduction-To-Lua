# Introduction To Lua

[Stratus3D](http://stratus3d.com/)

Code samples and demos for my Lua talk at the Sarasota Software Engineers User Group on 8/27/2015.

##Abstract
Few of these languages are simple enough to be embedded in existing applications easily. 
Lua's extensibility and simplicity makes it an ideal choice for embedded scripting. 
Lua is often embedded in video games, desktop GUI applications, server software, and even mobile applications. 
This talk covers the basics of the Lua. 
Trevor will demonstrate how Lua's simplicity allows for quick development of small utility scripts. 
I will also show how Lua's powerful meta-mechanisms allow for rapid development of software in prototypal OO, classical OO, and functional paradigms. 
At the end of the talk I will integrate Lua into an existing application.
